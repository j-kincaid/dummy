        When I was eight years old I started collecting beads and making things with beads and thread. I've earned a Masters in Fine Art, and my work has been exhibited internationally. Visit the Gallery

      <p>During my internship I worked with the development team to create the front end application for non-touch screens in Vue and Electron, featuring an image slider and API requests from DI's custom-built CMS. Two large screens display separate slideshows, on view in Menorah Medical Center's Legacy Hall.</p>

      <p>DjangoFest KC (formerly Django Girls KC) is a yearly event facilitated by Kansas City Women in Technology.

      <h4>Development Internship, Trivial, Inc, 2022</h4>
      <section className="imgBox" style="height:200px;"></section>
      <p>
        During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
        the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful
        application. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing
        within our automation product.</p>
